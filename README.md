#SassBase

v1.2.2

A simple, responsive themed framework to get your Sass projects up and running fast.

##Set-up

-  Go to your project folder: 
   
   `cd your/project/directory`
-  Clone this repository into your project (note the `.` at the end):

   `git clone https://github.com/edsloan/sassbase.git .`
-  Run this command to start watching the main Sass file:

   `sass --watch css/sass/styles.scss:css/styles.css --style expanded`
-  Now you are good to go create awesomeness!

##Notes

-  SassBase uses by default [g.css](https://github.com/edsloan/g.css) as its responsive grid system and [jQuery 1.11.1](http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js).

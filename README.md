#SassBase

v1.0

A simple, responsive themed boilerplate to get your Sass projects up and running fast.

##Set-up

-  Go to your project folder: 
   
   `cd project/directory`
-  Clone this repository into your project (note the `.` at the end):

   `git clone https://github.com/edsloan/sassbase.git .`
-  Go to the Sass directory:

   `cd css/sass`
-  Run the command to start watching your main Sass file:

   `sass --watch styles.scss:../styles.css --style expanded`
-  Now you are good to go create awesomeness!

##Notes

-  Please delete the `safe-to-delete.tmp` files found in the fonts and images directories.
-  SassBase uses [g.css](https://github.com/edsloan/g.css) as it's responsive grid system and jQuery 1.11.1
